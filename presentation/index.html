              The man behind of Linux named Linus Torvalds. That start coding on
              his grandfather’s computer Commodore VIC-20, when he was 11-12
              years old and this computer used BASIC. Linus says that according
              to his sister Sara, the first code he showed her was a two-line
              “GOTO” program in BASIC. He tried to show-off his new programming
              skills on the Commodore by making it repeat “Sara is the best.”

            Torvalds first published the Linux kernel under its own licence,
            which had a restriction on commercial activity. It was with version
            0.12 in <span class="date-highlight">February’1992</span> that Linux
            Kernel was released under
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License"
              >GPL</a

            Another important date in the history of Linux is
            <span class="date-highlight">1997</span> when
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">GNOME Project</a> was
            born. GNOME is one of the most successful open source projects. It
            has been crucial to the spread of desktop Linux. It has given us a
            number of programs that we use today on desktop Linux and a year
            after in <span>1998</span>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE">KDE</a>
            1.0 released. Another crucial part of desktop Linux.

		  Next one is not a historical day, but I guess it should be

		  came bundled with Microsoft Windows, Linux users around the world
		  went to Microsoft’s offices to return their unused licenses of
		  Windows.

            In <span class="date-highlight">2000</span> Steve Jobs offered Linus
            Torvalds to come work for Mac OS to make “Unix for the biggest user
            base”. Also, Jobs even tried to persuade Linus to drop working on
            Linux.Obviously, Linus refused the offer. The next year Microsoft
            CEO Steve Ballmer said about Linux: “Linux is a cancer that attaches
            itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches”.

		<span class="date-highlight">On 20th October 2004</span>, Ubuntu 4.10

		  For years, software
		  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper">BitKeeper</a> was
		  used for version control in Linux Kernel development.
		  When in <span class="date-highlight">2005</span>, the founder of BitKeeper decided
		  to not provide the free version to the community anymore. Linus
		  Torvalds decided to work on his own version control system and thus
		  <span class="date-highlight">Git</span> was born. By the way,
		  BitKeeper was open sourced in 2016 but I guess it’s was too late.

            The first step for Linux in the world of mobile OS happened in

            Android version 1.0, a mobile operating system based on Linux

            So, we can definitely say that in the 30 years since Linux was
            launched, that operating system – has become the most important open
            source software project in history, powering all supercomputers,
            serving as the backbone of the cloud and internet, running a
            majority of mobile phones and mainframe computers, and even
            operating on the International Space Station.
